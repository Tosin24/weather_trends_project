## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare Long Beach temperature trends to the overall global temperature trends. The purpose of this project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Long Beach.

This project will be carried out in the steps below:
- Extract the data from database using SQL query to extract the city level data and export to CSV.
- Write a SQL query to extract the global data and export to CSV.
- Open up the CSV with Excel.
- Create a line chart that compares Long Beach's temperatures with the global temperatures.
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Long Beach's averages, as well as overall trends.
